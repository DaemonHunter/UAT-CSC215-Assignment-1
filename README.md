# 01 Assignment Game on!
* Finish reading assignment #1: This is not the entire chapter. Hint, the stopping point is important.
* Study the "Game over 3.0" program in your textbook.
* Start a new C++ Project in Visual Studio 2017.
* Name this solution/project "GameOn3x"
* Do not copy and paste, instead write by hand each line of the Game over 3.0 program. This is important.
* Test and see if it compiles and runs. 
* If it does not, welcome to debugging. Debug and fix it until it runs. The issue is probably a typo. Please see me if you need help with this.
* Write a comment line above each line of C++ Code that tells what it does and shows you understand it.
* Change the output from "Game over!" to "Game on!"
* Test and see if it compiles and runs again. Debug if needed.
* Screen print the output results of your program run. 
* Screen print your source code file.
* Turn in the screen print of your program running, and the screen print of your source code.
